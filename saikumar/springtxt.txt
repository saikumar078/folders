spring is came at 2003
jar --- java archieve
it content a group of . class files
war --- web archieve

combine  all web application file   that file is called war file  -- it represent 0ne web application

ear --- enterprise archiche --- one  enterprise Application

spring org 

 --intial name of spring frame is interface 21
 ---alternative for EJB( Enterprise java beans)
 the applications will heavy weight  and not loose couple.  We  want to buy serveres
 
 spring:
 
 we can create  light weight  Applications
 know need to buy  servers .
  cost  is less..
  
  what is reason for  name spring ??
   because  in usa people winter season is not god for them   beacuse   tempature goes to  -20 D
   
   and Ejb -- feel like winder and upcoming season is spring 
 so the usa people keep  it has spring

comparing  to  EJB ---  spring is easy (leaf symbol  they put)

 
 while   Awt -- are  heavy weight because they use o.s dependecny 
 
  spring  not use o.s depencies. it use  jdk libries
  
  
 
 
 
The @RestController annotation is used to create RESTful web services by combining @Controller and @ResponseBody, which means data returned by each method will be written straight into the response body
 
 
 The @PathVariable annotation is used to extract values from the URI within a controller method, typically in RESTful web services to access a specific resource.
 
 
 The @RequestBody annotation indicates a method parameter should be bound to the body of the web request, which is commonly used to handle the content of the request in JSON or XML format.
 
 
 The @RequestMapping annotation is used to define the base URI for a controller, specifying which URL paths are handled by which controller.
 
 
 
 IOC Container : is a  principle
 inversion of controller 

general  the user will create a  object, but in spring the  ioc container will  be create object.
 
 the user dnot create   object 
 
dependecny injection: design pattern

 
dependecny injection  will inject the object  into application 

configuring xml files
creating the project 
creating the beans 


In spring 
object= bean 
the bean are 
avaiable in the ioc container 

In spring it does not  create  every object.when we  tells that  time  only it will create .

 we tell  to  I want to create object ??
  so we use  annotations that @component 
  
  
  ApplicationContext context =SpringApplication.run(springbootDemoApplication);
  
   Aliean obj=context.getBean(Aliean.Class);
   
   obj.code();
   
   
   
  ======================
  
 In spring boot  when ever we want to call one class method into another . We have  make wiring that happened with @Autowired
 
 
 example:
 --------------------
Laptop ----- is class  

@Autowired
Laptop laptop ---- we have reference
 ==============
 
 beanFactory & ApplicationContext  both does do same  things create in the container and get object from the container
 
  ApplicationContext  it have  all perperites  what  are in beanfactorty AND ApplicationContext extra feacture  so use Application context
  
  
  =====================
 
 ApplicationContext context =new ClasspathXmlApplicationContext("xml file ")
 
 Aliean obj =(Aliean)Context.getBean("here register the class");
 obj.code()//calling Aliean class proteries
 ================
 
 when ever we create object   each time we get same  output   because  in bean tag   is by default    single torn
 
 singletorn=============  by default 
 prototype 
 
 
  <property> </property>====setter injection
   
   <bean id="beanId" class="com.example.MyClass">
    <property name="propertyName" value="propertyValue"/>
</bean>

   when ever  we want to call one class perperires into another class we use ref  


<bean id="beanId1" class="com.example.MyClass1">
    <property name="dependency">
        <ref bean="beanId2"/>
    </property>
</bean>

<bean id="beanId 2" class="com.example.MyClass2"/>
